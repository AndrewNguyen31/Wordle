# Wordle Application

This project is a Wordle application developed using Java and JavaFX. It provides both a graphical user interface (GUI) and a command-line interface (CLI) for playing the popular word-guessing game, Wordle.

## Features

- **GUI Version**: Built with JavaFX, providing an interactive and visually appealing interface.
- **CLI Version**: A simple command-line interface for playing Wordle in the terminal.
- **Word Dictionary**: Utilizes a dictionary of valid words for gameplay.
- **Game Logic**: Implements the core logic of Wordle, including guess validation and result feedback.

## Prerequisites

- Java 17 or higher
- Gradle

## Project Structure

- `src/main/java/edu/virginia/cs/gui`: Contains the JavaFX GUI application and controller.
- `src/main/java/edu/virginia/cs/wordle`: Contains the core game logic and CLI application.
- `src/main/resources`: Contains FXML files for the GUI and word dictionaries.
- `src/test/java/edu/virginia/cs/wordle`: Contains unit tests for the application.

## How to Run

### Running the GUI Version

1. **Ensure Java and Gradle are installed**: Make sure you have Java 17 or higher and Gradle installed on your system.

2. **Navigate to the project directory**: Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of the project.

3. **Build the project**: Run the following command to build the project using Gradle:

   ```bash
   gradle build
   ```

4. **Run the GUI application**: Execute the following command to start the JavaFX GUI application:

   ```bash
   gradle run
   ```

   This will launch the Wordle game with a graphical user interface.

### Running the CLI Version

1. **Navigate to the project directory**: Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of the project.

2. **Compile the CLI application**: Use the following command to compile the CLI application:

   ```bash
   javac -d out src/main/java/edu/virginia/cs/wordle/CommandLineWordle.java
   ```

3. **Run the CLI application**: Execute the following command to start the CLI version of the Wordle game:

   ```bash
   java -cp out edu.virginia.cs.wordle.CommandLineWordle
   ```

   This will start the Wordle game in the terminal.

## Testing

To run the unit tests, execute the following command: ```bash gradle test```

This will run all the tests located in the `src/test/java` directory.
